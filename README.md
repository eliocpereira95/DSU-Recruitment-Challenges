# About

This very project presents a solution to Xpand IT's Data Science challenge for a recruitment process. The pproblem is about investing in the stock market, done in a very peculiar fashion: a client is to invest in a stock, buying and selling it at the beginning and ending of each week, respectively. The goal would be to find for each week, which stock would give the largest profit.

# Requirements

Note that Python 3.11.4 was used in this work. To create the respective virtual environment simply write in the PowerShell console open at the main folder:

```powershell
python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r .\requirements.txt

```

# Usage

To retrain the model as well as making inferences with it, simply open the project in your favourite IDE (e.g. VS Code), and run the respective Jupyter notebook, `submission.ipynb`, with the Python kernel associated with the virtual environment that was created in the previous step.
